Selling points: sell that no reverse queries are needed


Fill gap in rewriting

Fill gap in dual derivation

Faulty: Find bound, error analysis, find dual
Find application for faulty?

use "purification of reduced state" reduced state: purif 12x
vs "representation of Gram matrix" gramam atrix: rerpres 0x gram 27x

define mixification?
introduce notation specifying every matrix domain, type? and states? yes, useful, also saves having to explain exact domain somewhere, particularly in concrete applications
notation: underscore vs [[x,y]]
rho^T vs transpose...

everything expressed in terms of Gram matrix: clearly worse than as RDM
choose 1!
Define G_H, G_HX
vs define G_H, use trx as needed
vs don't define G_H, use diag=1 as needed.

define matrix entry as [[x,y]]
vs define matrix entry as _xy.
define space X' Hilbert space without idle subspace in the beginning, or just in the one part in the dual bound where I need it now? Would it be helpful anywhere else?
introduce notation L(H), H(H) or so explicitly?

to remember: acti
