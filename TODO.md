Double-check: references to section
Grammarly
replace "in a future version", write
Change rho, sigma, pi to rho_xyz particularly for faulty ops


TODO for what's left in this version: error analysis, fourier transform, gap in semidef dual
context help for symbols?
Is it correct that adv bound opt size may be bounded exponential in truth table? if yes, would it be pointless??

I can prove some lemmas about reachable sets as well, and output conditions.


Revenge of the polynomial method: Upper-bounding the adversary bound's tightness
Symmetric problems admit symmetric optimal solutions



Selling points: sell that no reverse queries are needed


Fill gap in rewriting

Fill gap in dual derivation

Faulty: Find bound, error analysis, find dual
Find application for faulty?

use "purification of reduced state" reduced state: purif 12x
vs "representation of Gram matrix" gramam atrix: rerpres 0x gram 27x

define mixification?
introduce notation specifying every matrix domain, type? and states? yes, useful, also saves having to explain exact domain somewhere, particularly in concrete applications
notation: underscore vs [[x,y]]
rho^T vs transpose...

everything expressed in terms of Gram matrix: clearly worse than as RDM
choose 1!
Define G_H, G_HX
vs define G_H, use trx as needed
vs don't define G_H, use diag=1 as needed.

define matrix entry as [[x,y]] vs define matrix entry as _xy.
define space X' Hilbert space without idle subspace in the beginning, or just in the one part in the dual bound where I need it now? Would it be helpful anywhere else?
introduce notation L(H), H(H) or so explicitly?
