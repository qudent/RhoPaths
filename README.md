# Quantum query algorithms as evolutions of reduced super-states

A discussion of quantum query algorithms - and the adversary lower bound - as evolutions of reduced density operators in certain multipartite systems. Currently contained in the HTML file.

Hoping for feedback - either as an issue, or to fi1w+RhoPaths - an at sign - outlook.com.

Files:
 - [Main article: Adversary bound - dual algorithm duality](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/qudent/RhoPaths/blob/main/AdversaryBoundDualAlgorithm.html)
 - A blog post in a similar spirit is [here](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/05/reachable-phaseest/); I asked around whether this reproduces prior work, but didn't get an answer so far.
