# Quantum query algorithms as evolutions of reduced super-states and an adversary bound-universal query algorithm duality for faulty oracles and other quantum channels

A discussion of quantum query algorithms - and the adversary lower bound - as evolutions of reduced density operators in certain multipartite systems. Currently contained in the HTML file.

Happy for feedback - either as an issue, or to fi1w+RhoPaths@outlook.com.
